spring-ex08-security
======================

This example builds on spring-ex07-navigation, where Thymeleaf templates were used and a Bootstrap theme, SB-Admin-V2, was integrated into the example.  This is part 1 of a series of examples on Spring Security.  In this code, we add simple Spring Security with credentials contained in a cofiguration file.

This example has been validated with the following environment on MS Windows 7:

1. Eclipse Kepler
   1.1 Spring Tool Suite (STS) 3.4.0.RELEASE - for Kepler
2. Java SDK 1.7.0_51 (separate install)
3. Tomcat 7.0.50 (separate install)
4. Maven 3.0.5 (separate install)
5. MySQL 5.5.29
